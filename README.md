Hello, thank you very much for checking out my repository for the code I definitely made by myself.

Instructions:
1. you need Python installed. I recommend Python 3.10 for it
2. you will need to install Requests and python-osc with the pip command
3. make sure you have your avatar set like how you need; I will write below how to set up color-changing
4. open the program with Python. If it refuses to start up or gives and error, I will write below how to try to get it working
5. open this application with vrchat, it doesn't have to be at the same time, and the order doesn't matter. Keep in mind that this program saves on recourses and API limits, while the free version only updates every 5 minutes. So I advise you to start it up after your avatar has loaded in

How to get color changing on the avatar
1. this is a placeholder. I will add instructions soon

How to fix the issue of it not starting
1. Make a text document where the program is located.
2. type (python "C:\location\of the file\VRC_TEMP.py")
3. on the second line, type pause.
4. click save as and save it as start.bat, and change the file type to all
5. run the .bat file that was created, and python will tell you what is wrong
6. if it runs fine that is good, just run the program from start.bat instead of the python file directly.
